Password Manager that runs in a browser

The idea behind jsPasswordManager is to create a password manager that runs purely in an Internet browser. 
Code: JavaScript is capable enough to do the work and there are enough Open Source libraries available to make this work.
Storage: Storage available in a browser is two-fold. First, there is the Web SQL as a part of HTML 5 set of standards. Second, the portable data can be copy/pasted into a separate .json file manually as long as the app can generate code and make it available for copying.

Support:
WebSQL for Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/html5-websql-for-firefox/
